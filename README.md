# Python tools for VStim

[![Python Tests](https://github.com/brain-bremen/vstim-python-tools/actions/workflows/python-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/brain-bremen/vstim-python-tools/actions/workflows/python-tests.yml)

This repository contains Python tools for analyzing output files (currently TDR only) of the
visual stimulation software VStim used at the Brain Research Institute of University of
Bremen.

In future versions, tools for remote controlling/scripting VStim, manipulating the config
files and event files may be added.
